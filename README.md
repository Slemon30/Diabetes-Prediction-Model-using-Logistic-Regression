# Diabetes Prediction Model Using Logistic Regression

This project implements a Diabetes Prediction Model using Logistic Regression, achieving an accuracy of 96.06% on the dataset provided. The model predicts whether a patient is diabetic or not based on their medical and demographic data.

### **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle.

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset/data

### **About the Dataset**

The Diabetes Prediction dataset contains medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status (positive or negative). It includes the following features:

1. Age
2. Gender
3. Body Mass Index (BMI)
4. Hypertension
5. Heart Disease
6. Smoking History
7. HbA1c Level
8. Blood Glucose Level

This dataset consists of 100,000 rows.

### **Applications**

1. Assisting healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk patients for diabetes.
2. Developing personalized treatment plans for patients based on their medical history.
3. Exploring the relationships between medical and demographic factors and diabetes prevalence.

### **Tech Used**

Python: Core programming language used for data analysis and model implementation.

#### ***Libraries and Frameworks:*** 

1. NumPy: For efficient numerical computations and array manipulations.
2. Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis.
3. Matplotlib: For visualizing the dataset and plotting key insights.
4. Scikit-learn (sklearn): For implementing the Logistic Regression model and evaluating performance metrics.


### **Model Overview**

The dataset was split into *70%* training data and *30%* testing data.

*Logistic Regression* was used as the classification algorithm to predict diabetes.

Achieved a high accuracy of *96.06%* on the test set.

### **Usage**

To run the model:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install the required dependencies.

3. Load the dataset.

4. Train the model and evaluate its performance.


### **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the potential of Logistic Regression in medical data analysis and prediction tasks. By accurately predicting diabetes, this model can contribute to early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes.
